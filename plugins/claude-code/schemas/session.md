# Session

A **SessionNote** is a resume checkpoint written by the Basic Memory plugin's
PreCompact hook (and, later, the `/basic-memory:handoff` command) right before
Claude Code compacts the context window. It records what the session was doing
so the next session can pick up where this one left off.

Sessions are found by the SessionStart hook via structured recall:
`search_notes(metadata_filters={"type": "session"}, after_date="3d")`.

## What goes in a SessionNote

- **summary** — a short paragraph of what happened (richer once summarized
  checkpoints replace the extractive first cut).
- **context** / **next_step** — the cursor: what's in flight and what to do next.
- **decision** / **problem** — choices made and dead-ends hit, so the next
  session doesn't repeat them.
- **produced** — relations to the notes this session created or changed.

## Frontmatter

`type: session` and `status` are the queryable fields that power recall. `warn`
validation means a missing field is surfaced, never blocking — the user's flow
is never gated on schema conformance.
