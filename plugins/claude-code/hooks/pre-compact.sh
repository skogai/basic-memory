# PreCompact hook — checkpoint the session to Basic Memory before compaction.
#
# This is the write side of the memory bridge: right before Claude Code compacts
# the context window (and the texture of the session is about to be lost), we
# write a durable SessionNote to the graph so the next session can resume from it.
#
# Phase 1 is the *extractive* cut (see DESIGN.md): we lift the opening request and
# the most recent turns straight from the transcript — no LLM call. Verified (Q2)
# that PreCompact has a ~600s budget, so a real LLM-summarized checkpoint is the
# planned "enrich later" upgrade; extractive is the safe, fast first version.
#
# Contract: advisory, never blocks compaction. Every failure path exits 0. We only
# write when a primaryProject is configured — we never write to a user's default
# graph unless they've explicitly pointed the plugin at a project.
