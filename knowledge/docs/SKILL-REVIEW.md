# Skill Review — Epic Overview

> 20 skills audited → 14 survive post-consolidation 10 work orders across 4 phases Hub: skogai-routing

______________________________________________________________________

## Key Findings

These emerged from deep-reading all skill files (not just SKILL.md):

1. **`skogai-skills` is a byte-for-byte duplicate of `skogai-routing`** — all 24 sub-files identical. Pure delete.
1. **`skogai-agent-prompting` and `skogai-prompting` are byte-for-byte identical** — only `name:` differs. Delete one.
1. **`nelson` is a copy of `nelson-base/skills/nelson/`** — nelson-base is the upstream repo (harrymunro/nelson).
1. **`skogai-docs` is unusable outside CORA** — 17 hardcoded enum values, stage references, CORA-specific paths throughout.
1. **`skogai-skill-creator` has only 4 unique pieces** vs routing — 3 Python scripts + some doc concepts. Everything else is covered by routing.

**Removed (6):**

- `skogai-skills` — duplicate of routing
- `skogai-agent-prompting` — duplicate of prompting
- `skogai-skill-creator` — absorbed into routing
- `skogai-git-worktree` — absorbed into git
- `nelson-base` — nelson becomes symlink to it
- `skogai-wip` — container removed, lore-creation graduated

| Cluster            | Finding                                                                                                                                                       | Resolution                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Skill Creation** | `skogai-skills` = exact copy of `skogai-routing`. `skogai-skill-creator` has 4 unique items.                                                                  | Delete skills. Absorb skill-creator's scripts into routing.                                                                 |
| **Prompting**      | `skogai-agent-prompting` = exact copy of `skogai-prompting`.                                                                                                  | Delete one (keep whichever name fits scope).                                                                                |
| **Git**            | `skogai-git-worktree` is a subset of `skogai-git` (adds worktree-manager.sh + .env handling). `skogai-worktrunk` covers wt/gita tool config — distinct scope. | Merge git-worktree → git. Sharpen git vs worktrunk boundary (git = workflow orchestration, worktrunk = tool configuration). |
| **Nelson**         | `nelson-base` is upstream repo. `nelson` is extracted copy. SKILL.md identical.                                                                               | Make nelson a symlink to nelson-base/skills/nelson/.                                                                        |
| **Docs/Knowledge** | `skogai-docs` hardcodes CORA. `skogai-wip/lore-creation` is orphaned in undocumented container.                                                               | Decouple docs from CORA. Graduate lore-creation to top-level.                                                               |

| [WO-6](work-orders/WO-06-graduate-lore-creation.md) | Graduate lore-creation   | Move to top-level, add frontmatter, remove WIP container. Decision gate: enrich before or after?     | 9     | Currently 160 lines, style-guide only              |

| [WO-7](work-orders/WO-07-git-worktrunk-boundary.md) | Git vs worktrunk boundary        | Remove duplicated command references, add cross-refs, document: git = "what workflow" / worktrunk = "how tools work" | ~8    | Depends on WO-1                            |

### Phase 3 — after Phase 2
