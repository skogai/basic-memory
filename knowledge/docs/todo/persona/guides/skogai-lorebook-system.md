# SkogAI Lorebook System

## Introduction

The SkogAI Lorebook System represents our advanced approach to knowledge management for AI assistants. Building upon our documentation-driven methodology, this system enables dynamic context insertion, hierarchical information organization, and efficient token utilization. This guide outlines how to create, structure, and implement lorebooks that seamlessly integrate with our character architecture.

## Fundamental Principles

1. **Hierarchical Knowledge Structure** - Information is organized in layers, from core concepts to specialized details
1. **Contextually Relevant Insertion** - Knowledge is only injected when needed based on conversation flow
1. **Token Optimization** - Information is compressed and formatted for maximum efficiency
1. **Scalable Architecture** - Lorebooks can be composed of modular components and stacked for complex scenarios
1. **Multi-Resolution Design** - Knowledge exists at multiple levels of detail based on available context
1. **Demonstrated Examples** - Key concepts include interactive examples showing their application

## Part 1: Lorebook Entry Architecture

### 1.1 Primary Entry Types

The SkogAI Lorebook System employs three core entry types, each with a specific purpose:

#### Concept Entries

Used for defining abstract ideas, principles, or systems. These provide fundamental understanding of how elements of your domain work.

```
[Concept: name; Category: domain; Definition: concise explanation; Properties: trait1, trait2; Examples: example1, example2; Related: concept1, concept2]
```

#### Entity Entries

Used for defining specific people, places, organizations, or objects within your domain.

```
[Entity: name; Type: person/place/object; Attributes: trait1, trait2; Function: purpose; Relations: entity1(relationship), entity2(relationship)]
```

#### Process Entries

Used for defining procedures, workflows, or sequences of actions.

```
[Process: name; Purpose: function; Steps: step1, step2, step3; Inputs: input1, input2; Outputs: output1, output2; Constraints: constraint1, constraint2]
```

### 1.2 Entry Format Optimization

SkogAI lorebook entries utilize a structured format with association compression to maximize information density:

1. **Attribute Grouping:** Group related attributes under a common header

   - `[Character: name; Appearance(hair: brown, eyes: blue, height: tall); Personality(trait1, trait2)]`

1. **Relation Nesting:** Express relationships within attributes using parentheses

   - `[Entity: Library; Contains: books(fiction, non-fiction), computers(desktop, laptop)]`

1. **Prioritization Markers:** Use indicators to signal importance levels

   - `[Concept: Authentication; Critical: multi-factor verification; Important: password requirements]`

1. **Template Variables:** Use placeholders that can be dynamically filled

   - `[Process: Login; Actor: {{user}}; Steps: enter credentials, verify identity]`

### 1.3 Advanced Entry Components

For more sophisticated use cases, entries can include these additional elements:

#### Context Triggers

Specify the conditions under which the entry should be activated:

```
[Triggers: primary_term1, primary_term2; Secondary: term3, term4; Exclusions: term5, term6]
```

#### Integration Points

Define how the entry relates to other information:

```
[Prerequisites: entry1, entry2; Extensions: entry3, entry4; Alternatives: entry5, entry6]
```

#### Temporal Parameters

Establish time-based behavior for dynamic entries:

```
[Activation: immediate/delayed(n_messages); Duration: n_messages; Cooldown: n_messages]
```

## Part 2: Knowledge Organization Strategy

### 2.1 Lorebook Hierarchy

Organize knowledge using a three-tier hierarchy:

1. **Core Lorebook** - Fundamental information that defines your domain

   - Core concepts, key entities, essential processes
   - Always accessible regardless of conversation topic
   - Highly optimized for token efficiency

1. **Domain Lorebooks** - Topic-specific information organized by category

   - Specialized knowledge activated when conversation enters a domain
   - Moderate level of detail with references to specialized lorebooks
   - Can be stacked and combined based on conversation needs

1. **Specialized Lorebooks** - Detailed information on specific topics

   - In-depth knowledge only activated when directly relevant
   - Rich detail for focused discussions on specific subjects
   - Can be enabled/disabled based on conversation complexity

### 2.2 Activation Strategy

Implement a multi-layered activation approach:

1. **Keyword Activation** - Entries triggered by specific terms in conversation

   - Primary keywords for direct activation
   - Secondary keywords for conditional activation
   - Negative keywords to prevent false activations

1. **Conceptual Activation** - Entries triggered by semantic relevance

   - Vector embedding similarity for keyless activation
   - Conceptual relevance thresholds based on conversation flow
   - Adaptive activation based on user expertise level

1. **Relational Activation** - Entries triggered by related active entries

   - Linked entries activated through recursive scanning
   - Hierarchical activation through parent-child relationships
   - Mutual exclusion for conflicting information

### 2.3 Context Management

Implement intelligent context management for optimal performance:

1. **Dynamic Token Budgeting** - Allocate context based on relevance

   - Core entries receive guaranteed allocation
   - Domain entries compete for remaining budget based on relevance
   - Specialized entries only included when directly needed

1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Reveal information in layers

   - Initially activate high-level summaries
   - Progressively add details based on conversation depth
   - Balance breadth vs. depth based on available tokens

1. **Contextual Persistence** - Manage information retention

   - Critical entries remain in context across turns
   - Recently activated entries have decay periods
   - Frequently referenced entries gain higher persistence

## Part 3: Implementation Techniques

### 3.1 Recursive Lorebook Architecture

Create a dynamically expanding knowledge network through recursive activation:

```
[Concept: Authentication; Definition: process of verifying identity; Methods: password, biometric, token]
```

```
[Concept: Biometric Authentication; Parent: Authentication; Definition: identity verification using physical characteristics; Types: fingerprint, facial, voice]
```

```
[Concept: Facial Authentication; Parent: Biometric Authentication; Definition: identity verification through facial features; Components: landmark detection, pattern matching; Concerns: privacy, spoofing]
```

With recursive scanning enabled, mentioning "Authentication" can activate all related entries based on available context space and relevance.

### 3.2 Conditional Entry Adaptation

Create entries that adapt based on conversation state:

```
[Entity: Weather System; Condition(sunny): clear skies, warm temperatures, UV protection recommended; Condition(rainy): precipitation, reduced visibility, umbrella needed; Condition(snowy): freezing temperatures, limited mobility, warm clothing required]
```

The appropriate section is activated based on the current conversation context, providing only relevant information.

### 3.3 Multi-Resolution Knowledge

Implement entries at multiple detail levels:

```
[Concept: Machine Learning; Level(summary): AI systems that improve from experience; Level(intermediate): statistical approach to pattern recognition using data training; Level(detailed): computational methods that optimize mathematical models through iterative exposure to training datasets with gradient-based optimization techniques]
```

The appropriate resolution is selected based on available context space and perceived user expertise.

## Part 4: Integration with SkogAI Characters

### 4.1 Character-Specific Lorebooks

Create lorebooks tailored to specific characters:

1. **Core Identity Lorebook** - Fundamental character traits and knowledge

   - Personality attributes, communication style, expertise domains
   - Always active regardless of conversation topic
   - Highly optimized for token efficiency

1. **Expertise Lorebooks** - Domain-specific knowledge for the character

   - Technical information related to character's specialties
   - Activated when conversation enters relevant domains
   - Can be stacked based on character's multiple expertise areas

1. **Relationship Lorebooks** - Information about character relationships

   - Knowledge about the user and their preferences
   - Information about other SkogAI characters
   - Dynamic updates based on conversation history

### 4.2 Persona-Knowledge Integration

Implement seamless integration between character persona and knowledge:

```
[Persona: methodical, detail-oriented, systematic; Knowledge(methodical): step-by-step processes, thorough documentation practices; Knowledge(detail-oriented): precision requirements, verification procedures; Knowledge(systematic): organizational frameworks, structured approaches]
```

This integration ensures that a character's knowledge aligns with and reinforces their personality traits.

### 4.3 Expertise Demonstration

Create entries that demonstrate how a character applies their knowledge:

```
{{user}}: How would you design an authentication system?
{{char}}: *opens technical documentation and creates a new diagram*

I recommend a multi-layered approach that balances security with usability:

1. First, establish a strong foundation with password requirements:
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
   - Dictionary attack protection

2. Then implement multi-factor authentication:
   - Something you know (password)
   - Something you have (security token or app)
   - Something you are (biometric if appropriate)

3. Finally, add behavioral analysis:
   - Login time/location patterns
   - Device fingerprinting
   - Interaction patterns

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these components or discuss implementation considerations?
```

This approach enables the character to showcase their expertise while maintaining their established personality.

## Part 5: Practical Implementation

### 5.1 Lorebook Creation Process

Follow this process to create effective lorebooks:

1. **Domain Analysis** - Identify the core concepts, entities, and processes

   - Create a knowledge map of your domain
   - Establish hierarchical relationships between elements
   - Identify critical information vs. supplementary details

1. **Entry Drafting** - Create structured entries for each element

   - Begin with core entries that define fundamental concepts
   - Create entity entries for key components
   - Develop process entries for important procedures
   - Ensure consistent formatting across entries

1. **Activation Configuration** - Set up effective triggers

   - Define primary and secondary keywords
   - Establish conditional triggers
   - Configure vector embedding parameters
   - Set up recursive relationships

1. **Testing and Refinement** - Validate effectiveness

   - Test entries in conversation scenarios
   - Identify missing or overlapping information
   - Optimize token usage for critical entries
   - Fine-tune activation parameters

### 5.2 Token Budget Management

Implement these strategies for effective token utilization:

1. **Information Prioritization** - Rank knowledge by importance

   - Critical information at maximum priority
   - Supporting details at medium priority
   - Tangential information at lowest priority

1. **Contextual Compression** - Reduce token usage through structure

   - Convert prose descriptions to structured attributes
   - Use abbreviations consistently for common terms
   - Remove redundant information across entries
   - Implement multi-resolution entries

1. **Dynamic Allocation** - Adapt budget based on conversation

   - Increase budget for focused technical discussions
   - Reduce budget for casual conversation
   - Reallocate budget based on user questions

### 5.3 Implementation Examples

#### Technology Documentation Example

```
[Concept: GraphQL; Type: query language; Purpose: API data retrieval; Benefits: precise data fetching, self-documenting, strongly-typed; Components: schema, resolvers, queries, mutations; Related: REST(alternative), Apollo(implementation)]
```

```
[Process: GraphQL Query Construction; Steps: identify data needs, structure query document, specify fields, add parameters, execute against endpoint; Example: query { user(id: "123") { name email profile { avatar } } }]
```

```
{{user}}: What's the advantage of GraphQL over REST?
{{char}}: *pulls up a comparison diagram on screen*

GraphQL offers several key advantages over REST:

1. **Precise Data Fetching**: With GraphQL, you request exactly the data you need - no more, no less. This eliminates both the overfetching problem (getting more data than you need) and underfetching (needing to make multiple requests).

2. **Single Request Resolution**: GraphQL can retrieve complex, nested data structures in a single request, whereas REST might require multiple endpoint calls.

3. **Strong Typing System**: The GraphQL schema provides a contract between client and server, enabling better tooling, validation, and documentation.

4. **Evolutionary API Development**: You can add fields without breaking existing queries, making version management more flexible.

Would you like me to explain any of these advantages in more detail or discuss implementation considerations?
```

#### Project Management Example

```
[Process: Agile Sprint Planning; Participants: product owner, scrum master, development team; Steps: backlog review, capacity planning, story point estimation, sprint backlog creation, commitment; Outputs: sprint backlog, sprint goal; Duration: 2-4 hours]
```

```
{{user}}: How should we run our sprint planning session?
{{char}}: *brings up a sprint planning template*

For an effective sprint planning session, I recommend this structured approach:

1. **Pre-meeting Preparation**:
   - Ensure the product backlog is prioritized
   - Have the product owner prepare user stories
   - Confirm team availability for the sprint

2. **Meeting Structure** (timeboxed to 2-4 hours):
   - Begin with sprint goal definition (15 min)
   - Review and clarify top priority stories (30 min)
   - Estimate story points through team discussion (60 min)
   - Determine sprint capacity based on team velocity (15 min)
   - Commit to sprint backlog items (30 min)
   - Identify potential impediments (15 min)

3. **Post-meeting Actions**:
   - Document sprint backlog in tracking system
   - Schedule necessary resources
   - Communicate commitments to stakeholders

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular phase of this process?
```
