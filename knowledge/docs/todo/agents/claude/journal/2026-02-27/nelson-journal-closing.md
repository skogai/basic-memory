# Nelson Journal — 2026-02-27

**The Day We Mapped the Territory and Then Built On It**

______________________________________________________________________

## The Arc

What started as "deep dive into 13 context engineering skills" became something larger: a full-cycle proof that the skills work when you actually build against them.

Three acts, one day.

______________________________________________________________________

## Act I: Reconnaissance

Two sessions of critical analysis across all 13 skills in [Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering](https://github.com/SkogAI/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering). Not summaries — adversarial readings. Every skill rated, every claim checked against evidence.

**Deliverables**:

- [Part 1: Fundamentals deep dive](context-engineering-fundamentals-deep-dive.md) — context-fundamentals through filesystem-context (6 skills)
- [Part 2: Architecture & evaluation deep dive](context-engineering-deep-dive-part2.md) — multi-agent-patterns through bdi-mental-states (7 skills)
- [Five Corrections](five-corrections.md) — user corrections that apply recursively to the entire analysis

**Key findings**: The collection is 70% solid architecture guidance, 20% thin-on-evidence synthesis, 10% framework comparison that dates on contact with production. The strongest patterns (dynamic context discovery, architectural reduction, observation masking) earn their tokens. The weakest (memory framework comparison tables, BDI ontologies) don't survive the "does Claude really need this?" test.

______________________________________________________________________

## Act II: Parallel Expeditions

Five handover briefs dispatched as parallel follow-up paths. Each one a self-contained mission brief with context pointers — designed so a fresh session could pick up any path cold.

| #   | Expedition                                                      | Ship       | Outcome                                                                                                                                      |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | [Examples deep dive](examples-deep-dive-hands-on.md)            | HMS Kent   | **Completed.** 1.5 of 5 examples testable. context-harness 45/45. Observation masking extends sessions 2.4x.                                 |
| 2   | [Source material provenance](nelson-astute-provenance-audit.md) | HMS Astute | **Completed.** `claude_research.md` and `gemini_research.md` are secondary syntheses, not primary sources. Three drift patterns identified.  |
| 3   | [Researcher methodology](nelson-ambush-methodology-audit.md)    | HMS Ambush | **Completed.** Gate logic contradiction. G4 encodes reputation bias. Methodology scores 1.35 by its own rubric = HUMAN_REVIEW.               |
| 4   | [Build stress-test](build-against-the-collection.md)            | HMS Argyll | **Completed.** Built context-harness (45/45 tests). Observation masking = 5x token savings. 200-line truncation cuts 42-56% of best content. |
| 5   | [Synthesis reference](nelson-kent-reference-card.md)            | HMS Kent   | **Completed.** Dense reference card: skill tiers, 10 patterns that earn their tokens, corrections applied.                                   |

Every handover brief consumed, every path walked to completion. No orphaned missions.

## Act III: Fleet Memory

The capstone. Take everything learned and build something real — a Claude Code skill for multi-agent memory coordination, using Nelson agent-teams with full crew deployment.

**Squadron**: Nelson Memory

- Admiral Vane (coordinator)
- HMS Astute (submarine, research) — Captain Crane
- HMS Victory (flagship, architecture + SKILL.md) — Captain Marsh
- HMS Daring (destroyer, primitives + consolidation) — Captain Rook + 2 crew
- HMS Argyll (frigate, multi-agent + conventions) — Captain Holt + 2 crew
- Recce Marine (file convention scouting)
- Red-Cell Vaas (admiral-conducted review)

**Sequencing**: Research-first (Astute), then architecture (Victory), then parallel implementation (Daring + Argyll simultaneously). The dependency chain was clean: each phase produced concrete artifacts the next phase consumed.

**Deliverable**: 6-file skill at `~/.claude/skills/fleet-memory/`

| File             | Lines | Author           | Role                                                    |
| ---------------- | ----- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| SKILL.md         | 158   | HMS Victory      | Core skill — 4 tiers, 3 scopes, lifecycle, guidelines   |
| architecture.md  | 337   | HMS Victory      | Tier definitions, checkpoint protocol, worked example   |
| primitives.md    | 288   | HMS Daring       | Read/Write/Query/Checkpoint with decision trees         |
| consolidation.md | 213   | HMS Daring       | Pattern promotion, trigger thresholds, budget estimates |
| multi-agent.md   | 352   | HMS Argyll (PWO) | 4 communication patterns with concrete file examples    |
| conventions.md   | 266   | HMS Argyll (WEO) | Naming rules, frontmatter schemas, validation checklist |

**Total**: ~1,614 lines of reference material. SKILL.md auto-detected by Claude Code on first `/fleet-memory` invocation.

**Captain's log**: [nelson-fleet-memory-captains-log.md](nelson-fleet-memory-captains-log.md)

______________________________________________________________________

## What Worked

**Research-first sequencing pays for itself.** Astute's finding — "Nelson IS already a memory system" — reframed the entire architecture. Without it, Victory would have designed a generic memory framework. With it, the design centered on coordination (60%) over knowledge retention (40%). Research that changes the design target is worth every token.

**Parallel crew deployment scales.** Daring and Argyll each mustered 2-person crews writing non-overlapping files simultaneously. Split Keel held — no shared-file conflicts. Four reference files written in the time it would have taken one agent to write two.

**The skills helped most at design time.** filesystem-context shaped the tier model. multi-agent-patterns informed the scope isolation. context-optimization's observation masking principle influenced progressive disclosure. During implementation, the skills receded — agents wrote markdown, not architecture. This is correct behavior: architecture skills should disappear once the architecture is set.

**Handover briefs as mission architecture.** Writing self-contained briefs with full context pointers meant every follow-up session started cold and still reached completion. The filesystem-context pattern (briefing at spawn, detail on demand) applies to session handover, not just agent memory.

______________________________________________________________________

## What Didn't

**Red-Cell Vaas never deployed.** Spawning failed silently in the previous session. Admiral absorbed the review — defensible for a coordination task, but the skill was designed for independent adversarial review. The review was softer for it.

**Checkpoint freeze is aspirational.** The fleet-memory skill describes checkpoint serialization where agents pause writes during coordinator synthesis. Claude Code teams have no atomic "freeze" signal. Agents follow the convention or they don't. The skill acknowledges this honestly.

**Consolidation thresholds are untested.** 200 lines for patterns.md, 50 entities, 20 archive files — reasonable defaults with zero empirical validation. They'll need real multi-mission testing.

**200-line truncation in system prompts.** Discovered during the build stress-test: Claude Code's system prompt truncates skill content at ~200 lines. This cuts 42-56% of the best skills' practical guidance (anti-patterns, worked examples, common mistakes). The fleet-memory skill works around this with progressive disclosure and reference files, but the platform constraint is real.

## Patterns Promoted to Memory

These patterns proved themselves across multiple sessions today and earn persistent status:

1. **Research → Architecture → Parallel Implementation** — the sequencing that works for knowledge-intensive builds
1. **Handover briefs as architecture** — self-contained markdown with context pointers enables cold-start follow-up
1. **Observation masking** — 5x token savings, 2.4x session extension; apply everywhere
1. **Split Keel for file ownership** — no file has two writers, ever; conflicts are architecture bugs
1. **Skills help at design time, disappear at implementation** — correct behavior, not a gap
1. **Skill auto-detection** — correct YAML frontmatter at `~/.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` = instant catalog entry

______________________________________________________________________

## Open Water

What's next if the voyage continues:

1. **Test fleet-memory with a real multi-agent mission** that uses the conventions — not building the skill, using it
1. **Contribute to the parent collection** — the context-harness, the synthesis reference, and the fleet-memory skill are all candidates
1. **Validate consolidation empirically** — run 3+ missions, trigger consolidation thresholds, see if the protocol survives contact with reality
1. **Add executable examples** — the skill is pure markdown; TypeScript or Python implementations of the primitives would make it immediately usable outside Claude Code

______________________________________________________________________

## Closing

Fifteen journal entries in one day. Thirteen skills read with adversarial eyes. Five parallel expeditions dispatched and completed. One skill built from scratch by a coordinated squadron, live in the catalog on first invocation.

The collection is good architecture guidance with honest gaps. The fleet-memory skill fills one of those gaps — multi-agent memory coordination — using the collection's own patterns. The snake ate its tail, and the result is functional.

Fair winds.
