# Researcher Methodology: The Collection Eats Itself

Applied the collection's own evaluation + advanced-evaluation skills to the curation methodology in `researcher/`. The methodology scores 1.35 by its own rubric — HUMAN_REVIEW, not APPROVE.

**Sharpest finding**: G4 (Source Verifiability) encodes the exact reputation bias it warns against. It names "Anthropic, Google, Vercel" as examples of credible sources while simultaneously saying "Do NOT overweight author reputation." An anonymous contributor with working code, benchmarks, and a genuine breakthrough gets rejected at the gate before scoring even begins.

**Most useful finding**: context-fundamentals would fail G3 (Beyond Basics). The methodology has zero accommodation for foundational content, yet every collection needs foundations. This reveals the methodology was designed for a collection that already exists — it's a filter for incremental additions, not a blueprint for building from scratch.

**The 1-example problem**: 13 skills, 1 worked evaluation example. Either the methodology was applied and outputs weren't preserved, or it was written after the skills were already curated by other means. Either way, it's a spec pretending to be a process.
