# Captain's Log — Fleet Memory Mission

**Mission**: Build a multi-agent memory system as a Claude Code skill **Date**: 2026-02-27 **Squadron**: Nelson Memory **Admiral**: Vane (team-lead)

______________________________________________________________________

## Outcome

**Planned**: A Claude Code skill for multi-agent memory coordination, with SKILL.md + reference files. **Achieved**: 6-file skill at `~/.claude/skills/fleet-memory/` — live in Claude Code's skill catalog immediately upon creation.

| File             | Lines | Author           | Role                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SKILL.md         | 158   | HMS Victory      | Core skill — 4 tiers, 3 scopes, lifecycle, guidelines                    |
| architecture.md  | 337   | HMS Victory      | Tier definitions, checkpoint protocol, worked example, anti-patterns     |
| primitives.md    | 288   | HMS Daring       | Read/Write/Query/Checkpoint with decision trees and failure modes        |
| consolidation.md | 213   | HMS Daring       | Pattern promotion, entity archival, trigger thresholds, budget estimates |
| multi-agent.md   | 352   | HMS Argyll (PWO) | 4 communication patterns with concrete file examples                     |
| conventions.md   | 266   | HMS Argyll (WEO) | Naming rules, frontmatter schemas, validation checklist                  |

**Total**: ~1,614 lines of reference material. SKILL.md under 500-line limit.

| HMS Daring    | Destroyer | Rook (+ PWO, MEO crew) | Core primitives                 | Completed                              |
| HMS Argyll    | Frigate   | Holt (+ PWO, WEO crew) | Multi-agent comms + conventions | Completed                              |
| Recce Marine  | Marine    | —                      | File convention scouting        | Completed                              |
| Red-Cell Vaas | Navigator | —                      | Architecture review             | Admiral conducted (agent not deployed) |

______________________________________________________________________

## Key Decisions

1. **Research-first sequencing**: Astute researched before Victory designed. This produced the key insight ("Nelson IS already a memory system") that anchored the architecture around coordination (60%) not knowledge retention (40%).

1. **Parallel implementation after architecture**: Daring and Argyll worked simultaneously on non-overlapping files. Split Keel enforced — no shared file targets.

1. **Crew deployment on implementation ships**: Both Daring and Argyll mustered 2-person crews for parallel file writing within each ship. PWO and WEO wrote the actual reference files; captains coordinated.

1. **Admiral conducted red-cell review**: Vaas was never successfully deployed as a team member. Rather than spawn another agent for a review task, admiral conducted the review directly — coordination work, not implementation, so within role boundaries.

______________________________________________________________________

## Validation Evidence

- SKILL.md detected by Claude Code skill catalog automatically (appeared in available skills list)
- All 6 files written to correct paths under `~/.claude/skills/fleet-memory/`
- SKILL.md at 158 lines — well under 500-line limit
- All references cross-linked in SKILL.md's References section
- No scope violations detected (each file written by its designated owner)

______________________________________________________________________

## Red-Cell Findings (Admiral's Review)

**Strengths**: Policy/State distinction clear, single-writer enforcement correct, progressive disclosure well-layered, multi-agent.md's "Common Mistakes" section immediately useful, conventions.md validation checklist actionable.

**Issues**:

1. Checkpoint freeze is aspirational — no atomic signal mechanism in Claude Code teams
1. All pseudocode, no executable code (consistent with parent collection style)
1. Consolidation budget numbers plausible but unverified
1. Scope enforcement is behavioral convention, not mechanical constraint

______________________________________________________________________

## Mentioned in Despatches

- **HMS Astute (Captain Crane)**: Research findings reframed the entire architecture. The insight that Nelson's operational patterns ARE a memory system — not just analogous to one — gave Victory a concrete design target instead of an abstract one.

- **HMS Argyll PWO**: multi-agent.md was the strongest individual reference file. Concrete file contents at each communication step, 4 common mistakes with corrections. This is the file someone would actually open first when using the skill.

- **HMS Daring**: primitives.md decision trees are immediately usable — "Need to persist information? → Is it scratch? Is it a deliverable? Is it my status?" An agent can follow this without reading anything else.

______________________________________________________________________

## Reusable Patterns

1. **Research → Architecture → Parallel Implementation**: Sequencing that works. Research unblocks architecture unblocks parallel work. The dependency chain was clean.

1. **Crew deployment for parallel file writing**: When a ship owns 2+ non-overlapping files, deploying 1 crew per file is efficient. Captain coordinates, crew writes.

1. **Skill auto-detection**: Writing SKILL.md with correct frontmatter to `~/.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` makes it immediately available in Claude Code. No registration step needed.

______________________________________________________________________

## Open Risks

- The skill describes patterns but can't enforce them. Any agent can write anywhere. Scope isolation depends on agents reading and following the conventions. This is acknowledged in the skill.
- Consolidation thresholds (200 lines, 50 entities) are reasonable defaults but untested at scale.
- The checkpoint protocol needs real multi-agent testing to validate the freeze/resume cycle.

______________________________________________________________________

## Follow-ups

1. Test the skill with a real multi-agent mission that uses fleet-memory conventions
1. Validate consolidation budget estimates empirically
1. Consider adding executable Python/TS examples (like filesystem-context skill does)
1. If the skill proves useful, consider contributing to the parent Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering collection
