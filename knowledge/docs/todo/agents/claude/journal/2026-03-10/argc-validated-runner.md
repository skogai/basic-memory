# argc validated runner

## intent

creating a single entry point for running cli commands with runtime validation. instead of running the binary directly we validate with the help of argc.

## what exists

- the skill `skogai-argc` and especially the references to the documentation describing in detail how argc works

## what's missing

- reading the documentation, listening to the user and asking questions before trying to *do anything*
