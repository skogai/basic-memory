# submodules → gita + symlinks migration

migrated ~/claude/ from git submodules to gita-managed repos in ~/.local/src/ with symlinks.

## why

submodules cause pain: detached HEAD, two-step commits, sync friction on startup. claude code's cache layer makes them show up as "ghosts" even when deinited. gita already managed repos in ~/.local/src/ — duplicating them as submodules made no sense.

## what changed

1. removed all 5 submodules (marketplace, worktrunk, claude-memory, gptme-contrib, small-hours)
1. registered 17 repos in gita under `src` group, all in ~/.local/src/
1. added `freeze.csv` as bootstrap/restore source of truth (includes URLs, paths, branches)
1. created symlinks: projects/ and marketplaces/ → ~/.local/src/ for legacy compatibility
1. added idempotency principle to CLAUDE.md conventions
1. cleaned .envrc (removed submodule update lines)
1. dumped scaling questions to inbox (200+ SkogAI repos, bootstrap script, group taxonomy)

## key learnings

- `gita freeze` is the real source of truth, not repos.csv (which lacks URLs)
- `gita clone -f -p` needs `-p` to preserve original paths — without it clones into cwd
- clone errors on existing dirs but still registers them — functional but not idempotent
- gita has a bug in `f_clone` dry-run path (unpacks 3 values from 2-value return)
