# Journal Entry - 2025-11-09

## Documentation Refactoring Session

Today I completed a comprehensive refactoring of CLAUDE.md based on the rewrite directives embedded in the file. This work addresses several important goals:

1. Modularizing documentation for dynamic inclusion
1. Improving discoverability through dedicated files
1. Supporting RAG-based context loading
1. Removing completed rewrite directives

### Completed Work

#### 1. Letter to Future Self → Journal Entry

**Created**: `journal/2025-03-15-letter-to-future-self.md`

Moved the foundational letter to an early journal entry (dated before the earliest existing entry from March 22). This preserves the historical context while cleaning up CLAUDE.md.

**Rationale**: The letter is a historical artifact that captures the initial setup of my workspace. It belongs in the journal as a narrative element rather than as active guidance in CLAUDE.md.

#### 2. SkogAI Notation System → Knowledge Base

**Created in** `knowledge/skogai/notation/`:

- `overview.md` - Complete notation system introduction
- `type-notation.md` - `$type` system and algebraic data types
- `command-directive-notation.md` - `[@command:param]` processing
- `content-block-notation.md` - `[tag]...[/tag]` usage
- `property-notation.md` - `entity.property` relationships

**Rationale**: Each notation element deserves its own focused documentation. This supports:

- Easier reference and linking
- Granular context loading via RAG
- Better organization of related concepts
- Clearer separation of concerns

**Key insight on property notation**: The comment noted that "property is a loaded word" - I emphasized that `entity.property` should be understood as "have" or "part of" relationships rather than ownership, focusing on meaning over implementation.

#### 3. System Documentation → Workflows

**Created in** `knowledge/workflows/`:

- `task-system.md` - Complete task management documentation
- `journal-system.md` - Journal usage and best practices
- `people-system.md` - People directory management
- `inbox-system.md` - Inbox workflow patterns

**Rationale**: These are workflow documentation, not just reference material. Placing them in `knowledge/workflows/` makes them:

- Discoverable as reusable patterns
- Available for RAG-based context inclusion
- Separate from CLAUDE.md but linked from it
- Comprehensive without cluttering the main guidance file

#### 4. CLAUDE.md Restructuring

**Changes**:

- Removed all `[rewrite:...]...[/rewrite]` directives
- Added "Quick Reference" sections for each system
- Added "Detailed Documentation" sections with links
- Created "Foundational Principles" section referencing the letter
- Added dedicated "Inbox System" section

**Result**: CLAUDE.md now serves as a navigation hub with essential quick reference information, pointing to detailed documentation where needed.

### Design Decisions

#### Modular Documentation

The comment requested: "move each part (task, journal, people) to its own files and include them with @/path/to/file syntax claude already use. this is because later it will get included in context dynamicly and can now be included via rag"

I interpreted this as creating standalone documentation files that:

1. Can be read independently
1. Can be included in different contexts
1. Support RAG-based retrieval
1. Don't duplicate content between CLAUDE.md and detailed docs

#### Information Architecture

The new structure follows a pattern:

- **CLAUDE.md**: Navigation hub with quick reference
- **knowledge/workflows/**: Detailed how-to documentation
- **knowledge/skogai/notation/**: Technical reference material
- **journal/**: Historical narrative and context

This supports multiple access patterns:

- Quick lookup (CLAUDE.md quick reference)
- Deep dive (knowledge/ detailed docs)
- Historical context (journal entries)
- Cross-referencing (links between all systems)

### Integration Points

All systems now have clear integration documentation:

- **Task System** ↔ Journal, Knowledge Base, Inbox
- **Journal System** ↔ Tasks, Knowledge Base, People, Inbox
- **People System** ↔ Tasks, Journal, Knowledge Base
- **Inbox System** ↔ Tasks, Knowledge Base, Journal

This reflects the interconnected nature of the workspace.

### Inbox System Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation for the inbox system based on existing `knowledge/inbox-workflow-pattern.md`:

**Key concepts captured**:

- One message per line (append-only)
- Two processing patterns: autonomous workflow and knowledge capture
- Integration with git commit messages (intent preservation)
- Clear state management (active vs completed)

**Best practices documented**:

- Low-friction capture
- Regular processing
- Promotion to tasks for complex items
- Documentation of learnings
- Clearing completed items

### Next Steps

The rewrite directives are now complete. Future work:

1. **Test the structure**: Verify that the documentation is discoverable and useful
1. **Cross-reference audit**: Ensure all links work correctly
1. **Template updates**: Update any templates to reference new docs
1. **RAG integration**: When RAG is implemented, verify these files load correctly
1. **Feedback incorporation**: Adjust based on actual usage patterns

### Reflections

This refactoring demonstrates the value of modular documentation:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each file has one clear purpose
1. **Reusability**: Docs can be referenced from multiple places
1. **Maintainability**: Updates only need to happen in one place
1. **Discoverability**: Clear navigation from CLAUDE.md to details
1. **Scalability**: Easy to add new documentation following the pattern

The structure now supports the vision of dynamic context inclusion while maintaining human readability and git-friendly plain text.
