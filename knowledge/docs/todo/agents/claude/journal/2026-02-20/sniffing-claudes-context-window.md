# I sniffed my own AI's context window — here's what I found

after ~5000 hours working with claude code, i finally built the tooling to see exactly what gets sent to the API on every message. turns out the context window is way less "yours" than you think.

## the numbers

fresh session, before saying a single word:

| category              | tokens      | % of 200k |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| system prompt         | 5,000       | 2.5%      |
| system tools          | 21,300      | 10.7%     |
| MCP tools             | 5,600       | 2.8%      |
| memory/CLAUDE.md      | 4,200       | 2.1%      |
| skills                | 179         | 0.1%      |
| compact buffer        | 3,000       | 1.5%      |
| **total before "hi"** | **~36,000** | **18%**   |

36k tokens gone. and that's *after* spending weeks trimming my own config files down to ~4k.

## where it actually goes

**system tools: 21.3k** — the biggest surprise. every built-in tool (Bash, Read, Edit, Grep, Glob, Write, Task, etc.) ships with a full JSON schema and behavioral instructions. you also get tools you'll never use. i have a Jupyter notebook editor loaded on every session despite never touching a notebook in 5000 hours.

**MCP tools: 5.6k** — i had a chrome browser MCP auto-enabled without realizing it. 18 tools at ~313 tokens each, plus the security instructions baked into the system prompt telling claude not to click phishing links or enter bank account numbers into forms.

**system prompt: 5k** — behavioral rules, git safety protocol, tone instructions, security rules. you can't change any of this.

**my stuff: 4.2k** — the part i actually control and care about. CLAUDE.md files, auto-memory, definitions.

## the bugs i found

### duplicate injection via symlinks

`~/.claude` was a symlink to `/skogai/config/claude/`. claude code loads the global CLAUDE.md from both the symlink path *and* the resolved path — but doesn't deduplicate. same 131 tokens injected twice.

fix: make `~/.claude` a real directory instead of a symlink.

### stale cached files

CLAUDE.md supports `@`-linking other files:

```
@~/docs/skogix/user.md
@~/docs/skogix/definitions.md
```

these get cached at some point and keep getting injected even if you delete the source files. i had removed references to those files but they were still showing up in the context — potentially weeks-old cached versions.

the only reliable "cache bust" i found: include `@filename` in your chat message, which forces a fresh read.

### the invisible cost of "free" features

chrome MCP alone costs ~5.6k in tool schemas + an unknown chunk of the system prompt for security rules. disabling it when you're not browsing reclaims that instantly.

## how i did it

two approaches combined:

1. **traffic sniffing** — intercepting the outgoing API requests to see the raw payload. this shows you *exactly* what the model receives, no guessing.

1. **`/context` command** — claude code's built-in context usage breakdown. shows estimated token usage by category with a nice visual bar. not as precise as sniffing but gives you the overview at a glance.

1. **session diffing** — comparing the API payload against git diffs in claude's message history to identify what changed between turns.

the combination is what makes it powerful: `/context` tells you the budget, traffic sniffing tells you the truth, and diffing tells you the delta.

## what i'm doing about it

migrating from a symlinked config dir to a real `~/.claude/` directory. the plan:

- **keep**: session data, transcripts, plans, tasks, teams, memory, settings, keybindings, history, plugin configs
- **drop**: let claude code regenerate its managed files (internal state, credentials, debug logs, telemetry, caches, shell snapshots)
- **hard link**: files that need to be visible from multiple paths — no more symlink resolution weirdness

every item tracked as a separate issue in beads for granular progress.

## takeaways

1. **you're paying ~36k tokens before typing anything.** on a 200k window that's 18%. on a model with effective quality around 16k tokens, that's more than double your useful context burned on overhead.

1. **disable MCPs you're not using.** each one adds tool schemas that eat context on every single message.

1. **symlinks in config dirs cause duplicate injections.** use real directories or hard links.

1. **`@`-linked files in CLAUDE.md get cached and can go stale.** be aware that what you see in your files isn't necessarily what the model sees.

1. **build observability into your AI tooling.** you can't optimize what you can't measure. the moment i could see the actual payload, i found three bugs in ten minutes.
