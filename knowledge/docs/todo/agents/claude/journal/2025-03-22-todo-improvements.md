# Todo: Context System Installation Improvements

# 2025-03-22-todo-improvements.md

## Task Information

- **Title:** Improve Context System Installation Experience
- **Status:** Planned
- **Priority:** Medium

## Problem Statement

Based on feedback from initial user testing, the context system installation process requires several improvements to enhance usability and reliability. Current issues include documentation gaps, command confusion, error handling limitations, integration issues, and a somewhat complex installation flow.

## Implementation Goals

1. Enhance documentation clarity and completeness
1. Streamline commands and improve error messaging
1. Add robust error handling and verification
1. Create a more intuitive installation flow
1. Improve integration with skogcli and other systems

## Key Points to Address

### Documentation Enhancements

- [x] Create context-system-getting-started.md with clear instructions
- [x] Update context-patching-guide.md with FROM → TO notation clarified
- [x] Add troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
- [ ] Create visual diagram showing the patching workflow
- [ ] Add examples of successful commands with expected output

### Command Clarity

- [x] Improve help documentation to clearly indicate directionality
- [ ] Add validation to prevent patching a directory with itself
- [ ] Make fork.sh patch properly handle the --help flag
- [ ] Improve argument parsing for edge cases

### Better Error Handling

- [ ] Add prerequisites check (Claude CLI, skogcli availability)
- [ ] Provide clearer error messages with suggested actions
- [ ] Implement graceful fallbacks for missing components
- [ ] Add verbose mode for debugging installation issues

### Streamlined Installation

- [ ] Create a single combined command for fork+patch
- [ ] Add post-installation verification step
- [ ] Provide a sample script to test the full installation
- [ ] Simplify the two-step copy+patch process

### Integration Improvements

- [ ] Better detect and handle skogcli environment
- [ ] Make registration with skogcli truly optional
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with various Claude CLI versions
- [ ] Add detection for existing context system installations

## Notes

- Pros from initial testing: well-organized scripts, comprehensive functionality, good performance
- Cons from initial testing: docs gaps, command confusion, error handling, integration issues
- Goose provided valuable feedback as a new user - we should incorporate all suggestions
- Future versions should reduce the number of steps required for installation
